# The courtyard as an inherent part of the building block
Greenery, since it was considered as a structural element in the design of Western Garden Cities, was proposed alongside the positioning of the housing blocks. The illustration from the architectural office that designed the building blocks shows the decision which defines the degree of openness for the communal courtyard in between the housing blocks. The smaller gap on the north side was designed to be blocked by hedges of 150 cm in height, and another layer of trees would separate the sidewalks from the bushes. The wider access on the south side, on the contrary, was kept open. The difference between the paving material defines the back side of the housing blocks with balconies facing the communal courtyard, and the front side with entrances connects to the street with a concrete yard for cars to drive closer to the blocks.
