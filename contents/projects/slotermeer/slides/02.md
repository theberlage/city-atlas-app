This drawing aims to highlight the evolution of the different kinds of boundaries expressed with diverse spatial elements throughout the years, investigating two different types of open public spaces: the communal courtyard in between the two buildings and the playground. 

The playground boundaries with the street evolved from an open access in 1976 to a more enclosed space in relation to the significantly increased use of cars in the 2000s, to a completely enclosed space in the 2017s renovation, in the search for safety. The vegetation in between the building and the playground is densified to increase privacy.

The communal courtyards evolved from low vegetation as a border with the public street in the 50s, to more diverse higher vegetation and separated areas for each ground apartment in the 70s, to the increased density of the vegetation in the middle of the courtyard in the 2000s and finally the metallic fence to enclose the whole area and additional elements of separation between the ground apartments in 2017.

(1) Proposal for vegetation by the architects , 1952

(2)Intensification of the boundaries for safety reasons, 2008

(3) Increase of enclosure through extra barriers, 2017

(4) Size of the tree three years after plantation, 2020
