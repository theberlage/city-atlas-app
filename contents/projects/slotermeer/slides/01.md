# General Argument
Slotermeer was constructed in 1952 as part of the Algemeen Uitbreidingsplan of Amsterdam proposed by Van Eesteren. In the 1990s, the Western garden cities including this area went through processes of urban renewal due to increasing social issues. Through activities instigated by the residents, the housing blocks were eventually registered as preserved cityscape in 2007. Since then, the district council has been focused on maintaining the buildingsâ€™ appearance through renovation. While the possible demolition of the housing raised loud debate, public spaces in this area have been constantly rearranged in the background.

The first rearrangement happened two decades after the completion. The playground extended the initially planned area of vegetation to provide more privacy for residents while keeping visibility between the public and private areas, The communal garden mainly followed the proposal by the architects of the housing blocks. In the 2000s, there was a clear direction to acquire a safer environment by adding restrictions on the pathways and boundaries of the playground. The vegetation in the garden intensified largely. Alongside the 2017 housing renovation, the housing sector restored the playground and the garden based on the 1950s values while pursuing visibility and control of play and access.

Overall, the appearance of the original communal spaces was brought back intentionally since its registration as a protected cityscape. However, the new interpretation of the design principles revealed that the balance was still in search, between celebrating the old and fulfilling the unresolved social concern.
