The drawing indicates the constant transformations of the communal courtyards and other public spaces of the analyzed area, in comparison with the housing blocks that remained as they were constructed in the 50s to the present day since they have been registered as preserved cityscape. The four different time periods of open public spaces showcase the transition from emptiness at the beginning, as there was a future plan for organizing those communal spaces, to clean and limited organization after construction, densification of the vegetation in the 2000s, and reclamation of clear visibility in the search for safety after 2017.
