# Balancing between initial design principles and contemporary concerns
From the 1990s to recent years, the attention of urban renewal in the Western Garden Cites was mainly oriented to housing blocks. The action taken on housing blocks in Slotermeer altered from demolition to renovation and keeping the original structural frame. On the other hand, through the transformation in 2017, the superficial outline of both the communal courtyard and the neighborhood playground now shifted back to its original plans in the 1950s, or at least, renovated with the intention to bring back the initial design. However, by looking into the way that the renovations were approached, we argued that the renovation aligning the original principles were compromised with confronting safety concerns. 

While the visibility was improved through keeping the garden clean, the barrier that separated the communal courtyard and the public street is now a visible fence to prevent trespassing, sacrificing the residents’ rich communal garden to the whole neighborhood’s safety concern. In the case of the playground, the concrete-made benches surrounding the area and the pathways were designed to make the playground still accessible from multiple sides, resulting areas prioritizing the play limited in four fragmentation with softer pavement.
