# Light, Air and Spaces for children
Despite the limited budget and time given to implement the expansion, Cornelis Van Eesteren, Jakoba Mulder, and Aldo Van Eyck from the Urban Planning Department of Amsterdam introduced the playground to the principles of the plan. With the spatial openness reserved between housing blocks to provide sufficient air and light, the creation of over 700 public play spaces prepared the newly built cityscape for the rapidly increasing number of children after World War II with its detailed age-specific approach.
