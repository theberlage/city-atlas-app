The drawing overlays the design of the playground from 1979 and 2017 to describe the similarities in the arrangement, chosen materials and play equipment, as well as the differentiated use of the playground by the residents today. 

The neutral play objects are brought back as a reminder of the original principles of the 50s and 70s playgrounds. The materials changed from hard tiles to softer textures, the 2017 concrete bench as a boundary, making it possible also for adults to gather around the playground, while still functioning as a barrier to ensure maximum safety which is the main factor that guides the transformation.
