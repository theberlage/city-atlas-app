# Transformations throughout the 2000s
Entering the 21st century, large-scale demolitions and reconstruction instigated from the previous decades was once formalized by the municipality through the project of ‘Towards Parkstad 2015’ in 2001, then followed by a re-evaluation on the outcome, questioning the scale and the direction of renewing the New-west of Amsterdam. Revision of the goals and methods in urban renewal asked corporations to also put efforts on public spaces, and the greenery was called for preservation and strengthening. In the communal courtyards, the vegetation planted between private and public yards were largely densified, and in the center of the courts gardening were found, making the once open greenery privatized. While less children play outside their house due to the fears of social dangers, traffic risks and the safety of play equipment, soft paving materials at the play areas and metallic fences to enclose the playground were implemented. The neutral play objects were replaced by much more specific ones, such as a slide and a table tennis board.
