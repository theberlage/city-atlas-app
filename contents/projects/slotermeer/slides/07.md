# The realization of the green system
It was not until the map of 1965 that the actual planting situation was finally documented. Following the previous discussion between the architects and the municipal director, the communal courtyards sited in between two housing blocks were fenced by low shrubs and only a small entry was left open. Including the whole neighborhood in sight, diverse patterns of positioning vegetation can be observed: along the places that people could stand, trees were planted in a ‘jazzy’ way; regarding the streets that people would walk through, plantation was implemented in rows; in between public spaces and private properties or restricted areas, multiple stripes of trees were positioned.
