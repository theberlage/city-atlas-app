The drawing juxtaposes playground and communal courtyard situations located on the Jan Postmanhofstraat in the 1970s and 2000s, evidencing the evolution of types of boundaries on the site. The limits around the playground evolved from total permeability in the 1970s to a significant increase in enclosure- with the addition of urban furniture (2), vegetation, and proximity of elements in the 2000s considering the increased use of cars. In 2017, the concrete barrier (4) completely enclosed the space. The boundaries between the communal courtyard and the street, composed of low vegetation in the 1970s, were replaced by metallic fences in the 2017s renovation (3). Its inner configuration shifted from diverse higher vegetation in the earlier period to a later increase in vegetation in the 2000s.
