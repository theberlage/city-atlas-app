The drawing overlays the 1979 and 2017 renovation design of the playground in the Jan Postmanhofstraat, to describe the similarities and differences in the spatial arrangement, chosen materials and play equipment. The configuration of the playground was fragmented (1), following the original design logic. The neutral play objects (2) are brought back in the 2017 design as a reminder of the original values of the 50s and 70s playgrounds, designed alongside the principles of Van Eyck. In the meantime, the paving changed from hard to softer material (3). The construction of the concrete bench (4) increased enclosure. It functions as a barrier to ensure maximum safety which is the main factor that guides the transformation, while keeping it possible also for adults to gather around the playground.
