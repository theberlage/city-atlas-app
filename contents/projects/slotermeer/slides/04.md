# The reality of speeding up a city-making expansion
The reality of the housing shortage in the city of Amsterdam was even more urgent since the need for reconstruction brought a large number of invited workers into the city. They became the first group of residents to move in, right after only a part of the housing blocks was completed in 1952. By showing the map of the neighborhood from 1954 and 1966 together, it is observed that the public spaces were only gradually constructed in the first 10 years, while the spaces were kept empty or only covered with grass.
