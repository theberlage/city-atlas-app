# Houthavens
By the half of the 20th Century, the increase in the use of concrete, the development of new road infrastructures and the enlargement of ships, contributed to a reduction of the use of wood and consequently the end of the traditional way of trading. Additionally, there was an expansion to the West, where new harbors were being developed, at a bigger distance from the city. The question was the matter of what the outcome for the area would be. The result:  the water between piers was filled between the half of the century until around 1985, returning to an adaptation of the original waterline. During this period, new companies would install themselves in the area and soon leave to places closer to the expansion of the western harbor.
