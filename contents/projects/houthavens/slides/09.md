# The Houthavens as a residential area
The strategic position of the Houthavens area, plus its increasingly condition as a residential neighborhood, put the area on the spot, once Amsterdam was growing and the need for its expansion too – largely embedded on the ideal of a ‘compact city'. While the area was being locus of temporary housing, a masterplan begun to be developed, aiming on the establishment of a multifunctional neighborhood. In other words, a mix between housing and work. Due to financial hesitation and reluctancy of the industries located nearby, the Masterplan and its Zoning plan were only approved in 2009.
