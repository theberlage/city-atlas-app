# The ‘comb’ structure
The second is the construction of the Oranjeluizen (locks situated east of the IJ) in 1872, started due to the need of water level regulation in the newly built Noordzeekanaal and to prevent the influx of sand originated from the Zuidzee. These two engineering projects established suitable water depth and transit conditions to further harbors to be installed at the banks of the IJ – including the Houtavens, west from the Westdok area. Curiously, instead of being simply an addition, in this particular case the harbor was dug into the original topography – being the first record of such a procedure in the city of Amsterdam.
