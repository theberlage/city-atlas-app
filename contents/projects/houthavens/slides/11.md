# The Houthavens as a residential area
The Masterplan predicted 2250 housing units and an area of 90.000 m² destined to alternative programs, such as a Waterprogram and shops/stores. It consists in seven predominantly residential islands distributed parallel, following the same orientation as the previous timber harbor. They each have a thematic approach, defined in the 2007's Image Quality Plan. There are various typologies and sometimes a parking garage is located underneath the blocks. Furthermore, in the western limit it is located the so-called Blok 0 – the transition between the Masterplan and the harbors nearby. This special block holds also social housing units and commercial use.
