# Houthavens
Towards the end of the 20th Century, the decline of the industrial character became clear, and the adjustment of program, inevitable. At the same time, some attempts were made in order to study possible interventions in the area, already projecting a turn into a residential neighborhood. Therefore, around 2004, several temporary student housings were built in the area, along with some temporary houses and a school. From the former timber harbor era, remained in the site only two warehouses, both located on the eastern corner (near Pontsteiger). Not long after, in 2014, they were demolished.
