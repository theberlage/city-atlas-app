# The filling of the harbor
By the half of the 20th Century, the increase in use of concrete and the development of new road infrastructures contributed to a reduction of wood usage and consequently the end of the traditional way of trading. Meanwhile, there was an expansion of new harbors to the West, bigger enough to accommodate the enlargement of ships and distant enough from the city. The question was the matter of what the outcome for the Houthavens would be. The result:  the water between piers was filled up until around 1985, returning to an adaptation of the original borderline. During this period, new companies would install themselves in the former warehouses, but no longer after, leave to places closer to the western expansion.
