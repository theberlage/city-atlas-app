# Houthavens and land manipulation
The syntactic drawing aims to emphasize the relation of the Houthavens area with the manipulation of land and, therefore, water. Since the beginning it seemed important – practical-wise – to establish a parallelism between building and water (represented with the ‘comb’ structure). This relation got lost the minute the program declined, failed to be rescued until the construction of the new masterplan. The new intervention implicates that efforts were made in order to maintain a spatial connection with the former timber harbor in the scale of the island/pier concerning its width, and in the scale of the building/apartments regarding its modularity. Nonetheless, when looking on the island’s/pier’s “profile”, the layers diverge considerably affecting the relationship between architecture and water.
