# Houthavens 1:50
At a closer scale, the four phases evidence programmatic relations to the transformations of the borderline. In the earliest period, warehouses (1) occupied integrally the piers width, facilitating wood shipment and unloading  - which would come fluctuating through the water. Around 1950 these canals began to be filled (2), after the port fell into disuse. Up until the late Twentieth Century, construction-related companies (3) occupied the empty warehouses and used the filled canals for parking and circulation. Moving closer to bigger harbors, these companies migrated, resulting in the warehouseâ€™s demolition (4) and further construction of multilevel housing blocks, in the 2010s. Buildings located in the Wiborgeiland include semi-private terraces, underground garages and living spaces. With the addition of canals, water was physically brought closer to such spaces and also interpreted for leisure and housing purposes.
