# Now vs. Then
On the other hand, the warehouses plans demonstrate a much simpler relationship between building and water. There was almost no public space and the architectural interventions were limited to the ground floor plan, with the exception of eventual points of structural unloading. Even the canals had the same size and depth, being able to shelter the same types of boats. However, when comparing the modularity of the apartments with the structural modules of the warehouses, one realizes they are, in some cases, analogous. The width of the apartments, follows in some degree, the width of the warehouses (or something about half of the module) - establishing once more an spatial affinity between old and new.
