# Now vs. Then
Not only following the orientation of the former timber port, interestingly some of the islands are positioned sufficiently in accordance with the previous piers, suggesting an intention of resemblance with the past. The Wiborgeiland, for instance, is placed almost precisely where the third pier was positioned, and its width follows the dimensions of the previous harbor structure (about 35 meters). Although the dimensions are the same, the relation between building and water changes drastically and the layers of public and private become more complex in the contemporary situation. When placing the building and urban plans, one can identify a range of spaces that varies from private apartments to semi-private terraces, to public street profiles. On an underground level, one realizes the buildings have floors destined for parking and storage. Furthermore, specific canals accommodate specific types of boat, in this case, private boats on one side and houseboats on the other. Finally, a rhythm is acknowledged regarding the modularity of the apartments.
