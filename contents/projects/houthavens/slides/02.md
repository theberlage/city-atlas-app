# Houthavens 1:1000
The drawing brings together four main borderline phases related to the limits between the Houthavens and the water, in the Nineteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-First Centuries. The earliest situation represents the interpolation between water and land from 1876 to the 1940s, ground for the houthandel (1,2). As of the 1950s, the canals were filled and the borderline straightened. Former warehouses located in the area, occupied by private wooden companies, were abandoned and later demolished, turning the area into a big empty plot. In the early 2000s, as a consequence of the Houthavens Masterplan interests, a second filling was executed (5). As a result, the area doubled its size and the borderline was projected towards the water. The Masterplan also predicted new canals, which were excavated after housing blocks were built.
