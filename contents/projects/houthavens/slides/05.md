# Methodology of investigation
The piers were divided in parcels – as shows the background map – numbered from left to right and from 01 to 16. The process of research revealed that there was a warehouse project for each designated plot, according to the company they belonged and the number of the plot they were located. The warehouse's floor plans show that all of them follow the same typology, with minimum variation regarding its modularity and width.
