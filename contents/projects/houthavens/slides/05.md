# Methodology of Investigation
The configuration of the Houthavens consist in a ‘comb structure’, or an intercalation of land and water, where there are several warehouses disposed parallelly to the water. The function of this port was not only to storage wood, but also manufacture and process it, in order to be transferred afterwards or used in construction. The wood – often originated from Scandinavia – would arrive in cargo ships and be loaded into the interior of the warehouses. Less frequently, there were cases that the logs of wood would fluctuate over the water toward the docks, being then carried into the sheds. In 1889, a railway was built to improve the logistics of wood shipment and the connection between harbor and city.
