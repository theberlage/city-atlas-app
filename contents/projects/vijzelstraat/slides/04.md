# Mixed-use functions along the Vijzelstraat in the 19th century
Following Amsterdamâ€™s fourth extension, the city entered a long period of stagnation with little transformation in the city. Entering the second half of the 19th century, the Vijzelstraat maintained its commercial character as a narrow but lively shopping street with clothing stores, bakeries and pharmacies on the ground floor and residences on top. This type of buildings of 3 to 4 floors with commerce on the ground floor and housing on top were common on these perpendicular streets that crossed the canals, like Vijzelstraat.
