The drawing targets the historical evolution of Vijzelstraat’s transformation by depicting the section  from Herengracht to Prinsengracht, where 65 buildings of its western side (1) were demolished to widen the street, beginning in 1926, to be replaced by two large volumes. The transformation additionally entailed modernizing the tram system and accommodating car traffic. The original 17th-century buildings had three to four floors whereas the two new ones reached up to eight floors. The apartment building ‘Amstelstein’ (3) was designed by Jo van der Mey  in 1928 and provisioned arcades in the ground floor that would accommodate new stores. In contrast, the office building of the trading company (2) constructed by K. De Bazel in 1926, did not account for such function in the ground floor.  Amstelstein was demolished in 1962 due to structural failure and was replaced by a modern office building (4) that maintained its metropolitan scale and commercial character.
