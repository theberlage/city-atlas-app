# Scale 1:1000
In the section of Vijzelstraat from Herengracht to Prinsengracht, 65 buildings of its western side were demolished to widen the street. In their place, two large volumes emerged that radically changed the scale of the street. The original 17th-century buildings had three to four floors whereas the two new buildings reached up to eight floors. The new plan of the street was designed by Karel De Bazel who integrated arcades in the ground floor of Amstelstein to maintain the commercial character on the ground floor, in contrast to the building of the trading company that did not include them. Amstelstein was demolished in 1962 due to structural failure and was replaced by a modern office building that maintained its metropolitan scale and commercial character. This transformation aimed to strengthen Vijzelstraat's role as a thoroughfare connecting the city center to the south. It involved modernizing the tram system and accommodating car traffic.
