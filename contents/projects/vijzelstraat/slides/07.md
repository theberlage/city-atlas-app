The drawing juxtaposes the original 17th century typology that had shops on the ground floor and housing on top with the new Amstelstein apartment building that provisioned the same functional qualities. The new, larger structure was thus designed with arcades and shops on the ground floor and apartments on top. As the arcades reached up to 6.30 meters, the sidewalk became the extension of the commercial activity. The new stores benefited from the emergence of new technologies in materials like steel and glass that allowed the introduction of large glass vitrines. These changes in the facade increased the interaction between goods and consumers and therefore the profit of the shop owners. In parallel, the existing buildings of the eastern side of the street underwent much more discreet transformations, preserving their scale as well as the original architecture.
