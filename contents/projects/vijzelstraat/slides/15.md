The drawing examines the application of the new construction materials both as part of completely new structures and in smaller scale interventions to the existing facades; this further represents how these changes influenced the adjacent functions. The Twentieth Century introduced the use of steel and reinforced concrete that enabled the construction of larger spans that could be filled with extensive glass surfaces. The facades of the new buildings like Amstelstein (1) deployed the new technology and revolutionized the way shops interacted with pedestrians, while the existing buildings on the eastern side of Vijzelstraat also modernized their facades (3) in regards to design, materials and sizes. The original facades (2) were designed with ornamental elements around the wooden window frames whereas the new ones lacked the sculptural aspect and used steel frames to maximize public exposure of the interior.
