# General Argument
Vijzelstraat’s most radical transformation took place in the early Twentieth Century, when a large part of its western side was demolished to widen the street from 10 to 22 meters, transform the street to a metropolitan boulevard and to accommodate new transportation networks. Despite the overall programmatic changes that the city was undergoing at that time, the street has maintained its original commercial character to this day.

The shift from horsecar to the car and the tramway system as well as the need to establish a better connection with the south expansion of the city, as provisioned by Kalff’s plan of 1875, were key factors to this expansion. In parallel, the turn of the century introduced new materials and construction techniques that gave the new buildings double the height of the original ones. The new urban plan that was designed by Karel De Bazel acknowledged the commercial activity and translated it into specific architectural elements, such as ground-floor arcades with large sidewalks and glass vitrines.

The scale and architecture of the new buildings, which significantly contrasted with the existing urban fabric, indicate a metropolitan ambition. Even though the Vijzelstraat was influenced by a broader international shift towards city formation, the maintenance of its original commercial identity overtime was intentional by the municipality and the scales of the two different centuries have co-existed ever since.
