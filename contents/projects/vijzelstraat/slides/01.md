# Vijzelstraat
During the Fourth Expansion of Amsterdam, the population of Amsterdam had exceeded 150,000 and by 1662 the three canals of Herengracht, Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht were expanded eastward towards the Amstel River. 

The city was organized around its port and the canals that govern its merchant activity. The canals facilitated the immediate circulation between the city and the port, while the embankment in between them  provided building land for houses, shops, and warehouses for the large maritime companies. The new town planning that was applied, was a reference to the worldwide town planning model from the 17th to the 19th century, proposing a network of concentric canals with perpendicular commercial streets, one of which was the Vijzelstraat.
