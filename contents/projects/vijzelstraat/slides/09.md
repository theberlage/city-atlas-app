# De Bazel’s Expansion Plan
De Bazel drew a masterplan for the entire redevelopment of the western side of the street which involved large volumes with arcades on the ground floor that will maintain Vijzesltraat’s character of a shopping street.De Bazel’s plan introduced three new large building volumes: the Carlton hotel, the Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij’s headquarters and an residential building, also known as Amstelstein. These new massive buildings of 6 to 8 floors, would radically change the profile of the street which along with its widening had the ambition to transform it into a metropolitan boulevard.
