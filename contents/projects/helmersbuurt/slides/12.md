# Helmersbuurt
Both Derde Helmersstraat 32 and Third Helmersstraat 34 reveal other methods property owners have taken to adapt to housing demands. In Derde Helmersstraat 32, the floor plan has remained similar to its historic reference. The current building is single-family and has been minorly altered to have a more open layout. On the other hand, Third Helmersstraat 34 has embraced subdivisions within the floorplan to maximize the number of units within a single floor. These rooms or units are subleased and typically attract young adults and students. In 2024, the municipality will once again allow multiple tenants on a single rental contract. At the moment it is divided into three different flats, but the existing promo states, "this building offers countless possibilities for multiple residents".
