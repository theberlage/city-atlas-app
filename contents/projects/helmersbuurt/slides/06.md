# Helmersbuurt
As a result of the Housing Act of 1901, some properties that had existed on the site since the mid-19th century were demolished or put under demolition in order to redevelop the neighborhood according to the 1895 plan. The site was built predominantly by developers who developed a series of properties. Within careful survey and analysis of the existing site on Google Maps, it becomes evident that there is a design code on the site. It is expressed in the presence of principal solutions at the intersections, emphasized corners, firewalls, repetition of buildings on the central axis of the block, deliberate design of a series of objects with accent elements, and exceptional units. At the time of 1909, Overtoom Street emerged. It was created on the site of the former Overtoomsevaart canal, which was filled in 1901-1902.
