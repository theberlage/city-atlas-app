# 1:200

At the 1:200 scale, the contemporary housing block modifications are revealed with common alterations including: basement construction, roof deck additions, and backyard extensions. The Twenty-first Century pricing increases are a reaction to homeowners finding methods of altering dwellings to maximize living space and increase their investment value. Many were unregulated at the time of their assembly as municipal laws on property extensions were unclear. These alterations occurred while preserving the traditional brick facades that characterize the neighborhood. Due to these alterations taking place on private property and hidden within the perimeter block, many were unregulated at the time of their assembly as municipal laws on property extensions were unclear.  However, this has since changed as regulation shifts are placing stricter rules on property owners as all renovation processes must be evaluated with respect to environmental concerns, property lines, and community consideration.
