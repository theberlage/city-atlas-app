# Helmersbuurt
<Plan de la Ville d’Amsterdam> (1774-75) serves as an early map that depicts ‘Helmersbuurt’ as a built site on the outskirts of the city center. The area is separated from the rest of Amsterdam by the fortification wall which formed part of the defense works that outlined the central ring. Due to its isolation from the city, ‘Helmersbuurt’ remained an unidentified site that was mostly characterized by farmland and ‘Pest Huis’, or the Plague house. The institution was built in 1630 for contagiously sick victims and mentally ill citizens of Amsterdam. Until its removal and replacement in 1891, the Plague House was visible through municipal maps and was surrounded by a small canal with a bridge leading up to its approach.
