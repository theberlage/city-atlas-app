# Helmersbuurt
The 1985 maps of Amsterdam published by the Public Works Department show the results of property parceling and the densification of the Helmersbuurt. Through these maps, it is evident the effect municipal regulations had on the planning of the neighborhood and the general typology of the housing blocks. The mixed-use block bordering the Overtoom, is modified to meet the planning standards of the rest of the neighborhood and create space for Eerste Helmerstraat. Though these blocks appear fixed, residents and businesses within the area begin to expand their space through extensions and backyard storage units. As Helmersbuurt maintains its architectural heritage, this theme of creative extension continues throughout the 20th and 21st century.
