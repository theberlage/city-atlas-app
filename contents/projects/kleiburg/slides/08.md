# Open Space : Early Critique
In 1972, a critique from two architects living in the neighborhood was published as a thesis project, in which the authors/residents proposed to solve the issue of the underdeveloped open space and lack of social functions by building low-rise buildings into the Maaiveld. The new imagined spaces would primarily provide alternative living units with individual garages and back gardens, and also introduce job opportunities and other varied public activities. It was remarkable how early on such a drastic reimagining of the still unfinished Bijlmer was proposed. The project stayed on paper.
