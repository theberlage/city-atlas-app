The drawing portrays a portion of the residential block and its relationship to the maaiveld. There are three major elements. First, the physical transformation of the Kleiburg high-rise building, in which the original Nassuth’s project was altered by NL architects. The unit structure of a typical plan was preserved (1), while the ground access points (2) and internal circulation (3) were transformed. Second, the drawing imagines two types of unrealized spaces directly related to the building: a pair of Nassuth’s collective spaces (4) that were imagined to be connected to the internal elevated street (3), and the OMA’s 1986 proposal for a seating arena perforating the facade (5). Third, the possibilities of the maaiveld, both real and imagined, are drawn spanning from the metro line viaduct (6) to the entrance of the building.
