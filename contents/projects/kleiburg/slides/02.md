# Nassuth's Project
Based on the CIAM principles, the Bijlmer had to become a special district, a city of the future. Siegfried Nassuth, who studied under Cornelis van Eesteren, was appointed the architect of the grand project. The main differentiating factor of his design was the ratio between the built and the open space. Large green interior spaces were created between the concrete apartment buildings, with bicycle and pedestrian routes. All other mobility factors were elevated above and around the ground level, leaving large portions of imagined greenery free of any infrastructure. Nassuthâ€™s project differentiates five types of green spaces: in the urban center, high-rise districts, low-rise districts, park areas and the green along traffic routes. The car roads were elevated and connected to large parking garages, the metro would humm above the vast green, and large shopping centers were planned under the viaducts.
