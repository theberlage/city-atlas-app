# Real & Projected Growth
The Houthavens is a group of former timber harbors located on the northwestern part of Amsterdam, between the Spaarndammerdijk and the IJ. Its origin lies in the development of some infrastructural events along the IJ, which triggered its construction in the year of 1876. The first, consisted in the excavation of the Noordzeekanaal – started around the year 1865 and ended in 1876 – an important maritime route that connects the Noordzee and the port region of Amsterdam by water.
