# Reprogramming the Maaiveld
Multiple interventions were situated in the existing fabric between the equally spaced hexagonal blocks: a drive-in cinema, open-air stadium, tennis courts, lake with a beach, a forest, and pavilions. New expanded viaducts pierced the neighborhood along the north-south axis and the Bijlmerdreef axis was reinforced and heavily densified with mixed-use functions. One crucial aspect here was the new imaginary of the Maaiveld. Instead of challenging the vast scale, the proposal sets out to complement the incredible scale of the open space with equally gigantic elements of public use.
