# Demolition & Redevelopments
The OMA proposal was not realized and the ground plane stayed unchanged until 1992. This year plays a pivotal role in the transformation of the Bijlmer. In October 1992, a Boeing-747 cargo plane crashed into two blocks of the D quarter, known as the 1992 Bijlmerramp. This event kick-started a sweeping renewal plan adopted by the Bijlmermeer Projectbureau to initiate a large-scale reconstruction. By 2012, more than 50% of the original buildings were demolished (in red) and replaced by lowrise blocks, contributing to a significantly different density and perception of the Maaiveld. 
One other important feature that experiences drastic transformation is the water edge. The original canal (purple) is expanded and new connections to the outer water ring are dug (blue). In this way, the by now dysfunctional vast Maaiveld greenery is replaced by easily-maintained water.
