# The Polder
Situated to the south-east of Amsterdam, the Bijlmermeer was originally a lake that would be continuously drained and flooded again throughout the centuries. Although the mapped history of the area dates back to 1525, it is not until the early 1960s when the plans for urbanization begin. As this map portrays, the polder’s original morphology is still intact in 1961. It is interesting to see that the outline of what once was a lake is maintained with larger canals and the interior distribution of plots follow a different logic from those outside of the former lake’s boundary. 
First steps towards urbanisation take place in 1962, when the Public Works Department of Amsterdam develop extensions of the original General Expansion Plan (AUP). This is followed by the reclamation of the polder, and in 1966 Bijlmermeer is officially added to the territory of Amsterdam, provisionally for 12 years.
