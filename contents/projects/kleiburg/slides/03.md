A comparative study is made here on the transformation of the ‘maaiveld’ & the built-volume. Bringing together six horizontal strips in chronological order, each one with its internal logic and weaved together by massive residential blocks. The bottom strip represents the polder and the wetlands as a part of the Bijlmermeer. The second strip focuses on the construction and the initial formation of the ‘maaiveld’, while the one above that, re-imagines the 1986 OMA proposal with confettis of events picked from OMA’s archive. An elongated infrastructural strip follows the viaduct that connects Bijlmer to Amsterdam. The strip above that shows parts of the large-scale reconstruction which involved the demolition of many parts, and the topmost strip shows the current situation of the vehicular invasion in the streets and the ‘maaiveld’ today.
