# Collective Spaces 
Activities that would take place in this green fabric, the ‘maaiveld’, are defined by the community spaces of two types: firstly, the ones housed inside the residential blocks (normally at the corners or extremities of the block), and secondly, by the larger public facilities situated along the Bijlmerdreef axis. 
The 13,000 planned dwellings are constructed in five phases (A,B,C,D,E) with five architect teams in charge respectively. Some of them begin at the same time, which would later show problems with the amount of maintenance required simultaneously. While many residential buildings are completed by 1970, the other public facilities and infrastructures lag behind.
