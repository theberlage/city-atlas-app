# OMA Diagnosis
In 1986, OMA reimagined the Bijlmermeer with a strong focus on the Maaiveld: “the all-pervasive buildings of the complex are the focus of its criticism, yet they are the least changed part. In our opinion it is not so much the buildings that determine the urban quality; rather, here it is more at ground level, in the open space between the buildings, where ambitions, qualities, and impossibilities should be developed.”
