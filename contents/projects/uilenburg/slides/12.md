# Disappearance of an Island
With the construction of the IJ tunnel and the plan to build a widened Valkenburgerstraat as a major motorway connecting the south and north part of Amsterdam, Markengracht that existed east of the island of Marken was filled in. The island merged with the city fabric that was once separated by the canal. Ground floors on Uilenburg in 1985 were rented out as commercial spaces. Some were used as offices, others workshops. Compared to two centuries earlier when there were numbers of bakeries, grocers, pubs, repair stores and an ice-cream place, the neighborhood had gained a more residential characteristic.
