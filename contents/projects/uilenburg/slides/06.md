# The Representative Axis
The project is particularly interested in an axis on the north end of Uilenburg, which can be clearly seen from the Loman Atlas. Taking an east-west section, the axis cuts through three typologies overtime: a series of warehouses constructed in the early 18th century; small houses between Batavierstraat and Uilenburgerstraat, later demolished in the 1920s; a new housing block that is yet to come on the debris of now small houses west of Batavierstraat, constructed under the commission of a Jewish organization in the 1920s. Plans of the small houses from the Stadsarchief Amsterdam show their cramped conditions. Some of these spaces house a family of up to 10 to 12 people on one floor.  Warehouses on the other side were generous in depth, despite having 5- or 6-meter wide narrow facades.Plans shown were speculated and drawn based on plans of typical 17th Century Dutch warehouses.
