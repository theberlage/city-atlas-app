# Residential Spaces Today
In the 1990s, canal houses on Oudeschans 5-11 were merged to create a new apartment complex with a complete interior renovation, keeping only the facade as a remnant of the past. The narrow building on Oudeschans 13 was renovated based on the existing structure to a 4-story modern home. Boats that are tied to the east side of Oudeschans also became homes with addresses and postal codes. The change in the size, organization, and quality of domestic spaces on Uilenburg overtime is an epitome of Amsterdam’s modernization and growth, and a conjunct result of private developments for profit and the city’s long-lasting effort in improving urban living conditions.
