# Hygiene and Demolition
Turning into the 20th Century, modern ideas of hygiene and improvement of infrastructure and the general living condition for urban residents came to the Netherlands. The country issued its first housing act in 1901. The Woningwet 1901 specified regulations on quality and number of residents allowed per home, while increasing the government’s authority in the housing sector by granting it the right to declare a home “uninhabitable” and the right of expropriation and clearance of slums. The Act decided that most homes on Uilenburg were unsuitable for living and should be demolished soon. The 1908 demolition plan of Uilenburg demonstrated the area to be demolished. Most small houses were marked, leaving only public buildings such as schools, and former factory buildings and warehouses. Demolition of the central row between Batavierstraat and Uilenburgerstraat began in the late 1910s, and the project continued until after WWII.
