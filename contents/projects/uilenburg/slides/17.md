# Uilenburg 1:200
The drawing depicts Uilenburg around the central street, with the historical houses that served as homes for Jewish immigrants, lasting for more than two centuries since the 1700s (1), a 1920s social housing block (2), and a 1980s apartment complex converted from a 17th century warehouse (3). It was common for the 17th century row houses to have a storefront on street level, rendering the alleys vibrant commercial spaces for small businesses and shoppers (4). The present street-level life was altered by new regulations following Woningwet 1901. Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat was made wide for traffic (5), flanked with parking and speed bumps that no longer encourage active pedestrian activities. The reconstruction of housing blocks repurposed the ground level for offices and residential units, resulting in a much more tranquil street.
