# Blocks and Courtyards
Uilenburg in 1985 had gone through major changes compared to shown in the 1876 Loman Atlas. A study done by the Housing Project Group at the Municipality of Amsterdam included a map demonstrating building heights on Uilenburg, in which it becomes clearly visible that blocks that used to be packed with small houses are now transformed into blocks with courtyards. The space between buildings allowed the infill of trees and other vegetation that didn’t have space on the island before.
