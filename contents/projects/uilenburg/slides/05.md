# Homes, Businesses and Industries
The Loman Atlas produced by J.C. Loman Jr. in 1874 provides a clearer picture of the organization of Uilenburg in the 19th Century, which remained largely unchanged over the two centuries of Stagnation. From the records from Joodsamsterdam, the ground floor of the small houses on Uilenburg were mainly occupied by small businesses such as bakeries and grocers,  while families lived in cramped rooms on the upper floors. The houses were constructed tightly against each other, leaving only narrow alleys and courtyards in between. Some light industries, such as diamond-cutting and coffee milling, still remained on the island. Albeit the difficult living conditions, it was a vibrant Jewish neighborhood. The Loman Atlas also recorded trees in the area, although most of them were removed with the major demolition in the 1910s.
