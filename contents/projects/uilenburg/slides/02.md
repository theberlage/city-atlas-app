# Uilenburg & Marken
In 1595, the islands Uilenburg and Marken were created for shipbuilding as part of Amsterdam’s 2nd Expansion. This 1597 map depicts the two islands in their early stage. Shipyards occupied the space along the canals, and residences for the workers stood in the middle. Water was a major infrastructure as materials for shipbuilding arrived via the canals and newly-made ships began their sails from them.
