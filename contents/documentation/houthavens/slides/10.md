# The Houthavens as a residential area
The strategic position of the Houthavens area, plus its increasing condition as a residential neighborhood, put the area on the spot for future expansion projects of Amsterdam. While the area was being locus of temporary housing, a masterplan began to be developed, largely embedded on the ideal of a ‘compact city’ and aiming for the establishment of a multifunctional neighborhood. In other words, a mix between housing and work.
