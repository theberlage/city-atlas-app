# The Masterplan
The Masterplan predicted 2250 housing units and an area of 90.000 mÂ² destined to alternative programs, such as a Waterprogram and shops/stores. It consists of seven parallel (predominantly) residential islands, which follow the same orientation as the previous timber harbor. They each have a thematic approach, defined in 2007's Image Quality Plan. There are various typologies and often a parking garage is located underneath the blocks. After the whole area was filled and the blocks constructed, the canals were dug and the Houtavens restored its intercalated relationship between land and water.
