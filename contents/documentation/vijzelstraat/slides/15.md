# Scale 1:200
The original 17th century buildings in Vijzelstraat had shops on the ground floor and housing on top. As the municipality wanted to preserve Vijzelstraat's commercial identity, the new, larger structure was designed with arcades and shops on the ground floor and apartments on top. As the arcades reached up to 6.30 meters, the sidewalk became the extension of the commercial activity. The new stores benefited from the emergence of new technologies in materials like steel and glass that allowed the introduction of large glass vitrines. These changes in the facade increased the interaction between goods and consumers and therefore the profit of the shop owners. Simultaneously in the eastern side of the street, the existing buildings underwent much more discreet transformations, preserving their scale as well as the original architecture.
