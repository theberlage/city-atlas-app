# The Palimpsest of Now
Bijlmerâ€™s original concepts of providing the generous, quality green space have been highly transformed in its 60 year evolution period. The experience in the volume of the green space has adjusted along with the changes brought by the redevelopment and the resulting shift in built volume. Envisioned as one of the core elements of the success of the CIAM-based scheme, the reality of the ground plane with its imagined uses never came to life as envisioned. Instead, the Maaiveld has rather been experiencing a more improvised series of changes resulting from the needs of the immediate time period and the issues/aspirations it brought along.
