The evolution of the residential blocksâ€™ interaction with their surrounding open spaces has long sparked developmental prospects in the Bijlmermeer. The initial emergence of the expansive maaiveld amidst high-rise blocks invited diverse proposals and speculations. Notably, the 2012 intervention by NL Architects altered ground access corridors and the internal building circulation to rectify the ground-level porosity in the blocks. Despite unrealized plans for plugged-in collective spaces in the original proposal, envisioned as hubs for public activities, the essence persisted. OMA's 1986 proposal aimed at enlivening ground levels to optimize the ground-to-built ratio. The realized and imagined potentialities expanded greatly as the metro line viaduct was elevated above the ground level, allowing for further permeability of the ground fabric.
