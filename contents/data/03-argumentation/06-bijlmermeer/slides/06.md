# Scale 1:1000

Before the 1960s extension to the 1935 General Expansion Plan, the Bijlmermeer encompassed wetlands and a lake that was drained and reclaimed in 1963, making way for a distinct layout of building blocks and the maaiveld. Key infrastructural elements lagged behind in Bijlmerâ€™s construction, and cars parked on the sandy ground right below the building entrances. Following the habitation of the housing units, the ground-to-built ratio triggered rigorous evaluations due to the social problems it caused. In 1986, OMA proposed radical interventions densifying the maaiveld, envisioning diverse activities and events on the ground. The proposal remained unrealized. In 1992, the Bijlmerramp incident prompted a large-scale reconstruction effort, leading to a vast demolition of the original building blocks and the rethinking of the site's accessibility. Garages and elevated roads were taken down, and the once concentrated car parking was scattered on the maaiveld, ironically returning back to the incomplete situation.
