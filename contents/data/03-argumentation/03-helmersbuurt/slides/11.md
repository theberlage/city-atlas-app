# Scale 1:200

The twenty-first century property value increases are partially attributed to homeowners finding lucrative methods of altering their dwellings to maximize living space and raise investment value. Basement construction, roof deck additions, storage units, and backyard extensions are common modifications. During the twentieth century, many renovations were unregulated as municipal laws on property extensions were underdeveloped. As alterations take place on private property, evidence of changes are hidden by the traditional brick “face” of the residential buildings, contained within the forty-five-meter wide block. The unregulated extension projects have resulted in several property line disputes between neighbors. Thus, over the past two decades, municipal regulations have placed increasingly strict rules on homeowners as permanent renovations must be approved in respect to environmental concerns, property boundaries, and community considerations. One example is the 2021 “Grondwaterneutrale Kelders” zoning plan which assesses risk levels of basement construction around Amsterdam.
