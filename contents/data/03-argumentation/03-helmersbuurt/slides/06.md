# Scale 1:1000

Helmersbuurt’s spatial configuration is the result of various negotiations between real estate speculations from private developers and the practical concerns of the municipality. The parcellation that formed the Stads Polder (1) acted as the formative outline for the Oud-West in Jan Kalff’s expansion plan of 1875 (2). The urban grid proposed in Kalff’s plan featured vast urban blocks, large boulevards, and copious green space. The arrangement respected three main characteristics on site: the Overtoomsevaart (3), Sofia Park (4), and the road of The Pesthuis (5). However, due to push back from developers, the large blocks were subdivided into smaller ones for greater buildable surface area—a sitewide grid of forty-five-meter wide blocks with fifteen-meter wide streets (6). Pre-existing buildings that fall out of the grid were demolished (7). Following these modifications, Helmersbuurt was rearranged into orderly residential blocks, transitioning away from its previous recreational and industrial function into an upper middle class residential neighborhood.
