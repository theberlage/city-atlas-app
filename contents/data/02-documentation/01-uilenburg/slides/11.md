# Social Housing Projects
Since the second half of the 19th Century, housing associations emerged and became active in the housing sector by constructing and maintaining social housing projects. The housing block occupying Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat 2-68 was constructed under the commission of Handwerkers Vriendenkring, an organization that aims to improve the living condition of Amsterdam’s Jewish residents. Architect J.H. Mulder from the Gemeentelijke Woningdienst, Municipal Housing Services, designed the housing in amsterdam school style in the 1920s. The project is a typical “van der Tas” housing type, a large, standard, 4-room housing type in which a small room and a living room faces the stairwell, another small room and a medium-sized room behind the kitchen, named after its inventor, architect and developer L. Van der Tas in the early 20th Century. The housing block replaced the cramped small buildings and back alleys with a continuous building and a courtyard inside.
