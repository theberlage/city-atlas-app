# Scale 1:50
The 20th century introduced the use of steel and reinforced concrete that enabled the construction of larger spans that could be filled with extensive glass surfaces. On the one hand, the facades of the new buildings like Amstelstein deployed the new technology and revolutionized the way shops interacted with pedestrians. On the other hand, the existing buildings on the eastern side of Vijzelstraat also modernized their facades in regards to design, materials and sizes. The original facades were designed with ornamental elements around the wooden window frames whereas the new ones lacked the sculptural aspect and used steel frames to maximize public exposure of the interior.
