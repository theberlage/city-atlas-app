# Helmersbuurt
The neighborhood blocks are an example of serial construction which can be easily recognizable by an identical or related design amongst the building blocks. This block is orientated between two streets: Derde Helmersstraat, which is a central axis of the neighborhood, and Bosboom Toussaintstraat which remains the leading axis to the previously existing Plague House. The block was mostly developed by the architect L. van der Tas. According to its construction drawings, the block can be divided into repetitive parts consisting of a series of units. Most of the units have a traditional three-window house structure with a backyard. Nevertheless, in 1899, the owners of 43 Bosboom Toussaintstraat planned to build an extension.
