# Helmersbuurt
Helmersbuurt as a formal neighborhood was first proposed in Kalff’s master plan to expand Amsterdam. This plan for expansion proposed a second ring of developments organized through urban blocks with street patterns following the existing farm parcellation. The ring was nicknamed the “sober belt” due to its qualities of having a low density urban plan, simplified architectural language, with greenspaces and an orderly street grid suitable for residential usage. The plan was a success and was used as a framework for the city’s development over the next 40 years. As the plan became tangible, private developers around the city were incentivized to start parceling and constructing property around the second ring. Helmersbuurt is a result of Kalff’s ambition and is shaped by his plan. On the eastern side, the site becomes defined by his proposal for the Naasaukade, a boulevard that runs along the geography of the former defense works. One of the notable attributes of this map was Kalff’s notion to remove the Plague House from the city context but keep its axis and replace it with a connecting street.
