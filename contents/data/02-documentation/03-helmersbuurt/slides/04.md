# Helmersbuurt
The Loman Atlas depicts the removal of the fortification wall from the Amsterdam defense works. The elimination of the wall enabled access to the ‘Oud-West’ and opened possibilities for economic migration away from the city center. The Atlas reveals the growth of businesses and factories along the Overtoomsevaart canal on the southern border of the site. The economic boom and favorable positioning of the Overtoomsevaart, or ‘Overtoom’, became a catalyst toward the development of the ‘Oud-West’ and ‘Helmersbuurt’. Additionally, the Plague House remains visible with the institution clearly marked along the axis of the current ‘Bosboom Toussaintstraat’.
