# Porosity & openness (after)
When the present-day situation is overlaid on the 1985 map, some significant transformations became visible. (1) The cut-throughs are reduced from 11 small to 3 larger openings. (2) The car parking is displaced on the Maaiveld, now ironically returning to the previously improvised location right below the blocks. (3) The water edge is expanded. (4) New low-rise blocks replace the Koningshoef building with a courtyard typology, creating a new edge that stretches from the water to the corner of Koningshoef. (5) The Kleiburg ground floor is replaced by live/work units and bike parking.
