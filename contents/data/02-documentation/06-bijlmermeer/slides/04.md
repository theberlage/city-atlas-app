# Real & Projected Growth
Maaiveld also emerged in patches, the rate of its development arguably defined by the respective teamâ€™s efforts. Only some garages were built, so by the time the first residents moved in between 1968 and 1970, the cars were parked directly on the sandy ground below the building entrances.
The projected growth of the greenery was calculated for the 20 year period. In a general section portraying the maaiveld between the residential blocks, multiple buffer zones were defined by the type of activity and vegetation.
