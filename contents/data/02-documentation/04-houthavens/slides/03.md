# Infrastructures on the IJ
The second is the construction of the Oranjesluizen (locks situated east of the IJ) in 1872, started due to the need of water level regulation in the newly built Noordzeekanaal and to prevent the influx of sand that originated from the Zuidzee. These two engineering projects established suitable water depth and transit conditions for the development of new harbors along the IJ â€“ including the Houtavens.
