# The ‘comb’ structure
Instead of being simply an addition, in this particular case the harbor was dug into the original topography – being the first record of such a procedure in the city of Amsterdam. The configuration of the Houthavens consists in a ‘comb structure’, or intercalation of land and water, where there are several warehouses disposed above the ‘piers’.
