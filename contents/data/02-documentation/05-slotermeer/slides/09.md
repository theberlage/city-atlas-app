# Separation between play areas and the rest of the neighborhood
In the year of 1976, due to the thickening vegetation in between the buildings and the playground, the areas of the playground on Jan Postmahof were tightened. Keeping the surface relatively small, prevented older children from taking the space to play sports and disturbing the younger onesâ€™ game. The bar in front of the housing entrance was turned 90 degrees, allowing space for access. Also, trees were planted on the edge of the play area, creating a loose boundary between the playground, the street, and housing entrances on the other side. The need for separation between play areas and the rest of the neighborhood had been implied in these two transformations.
