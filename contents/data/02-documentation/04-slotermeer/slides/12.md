# Balancing between initial design principles and contemporary concerns
From the 1990s to recent years, the attention to urban renewal in the Western Garden Cites was mainly oriented to housing blocks. The action taken on housing blocks in Slotermeer altered from demolition to renovation and kept the original structural frame. On the other hand, through the transformation in 2017, the superficial outline of both the communal courtyard and the neighborhood playground now shifted back to its original plans in the 1950s, or at least, renovated with the intention of bringing back the initial design. However, by looking at the approach to the 2015 renovation, the balance was pursued between the alignment of the original principles and recent safety concerns.

While the visibility was improved by keeping the garden clean, the barrier that separated the communal courtyard and the public street is now a visible fence to prevent trespassing, sacrificing the residents’ rich communal garden to the whole neighborhood’s safety concern. In the case of the playground, the concrete-made benches that surrounded the area and the pathways designed to make the playground still accessible from multiple sides, resulted in limiting play areas to four fragmentations with softer pavement.
