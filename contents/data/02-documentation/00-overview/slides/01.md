## Part I: Documentation

Documentation contributions to the project include collecting, categorizing, and annotating archival materials, through which students develop a comprehensive understanding of the changes in the urban fabric of respective sites. The work is done on three scales: the neighborhood, the building, and building fragments. 20th Century transformations of residential spaces on Uilenburg and the infrastructural changes along Vijzelstraat indicate the impact of the practice of urban planning, while modifications within the housing blocks in Helmersbuurt suggest traces of private activities. The development of Houthavens since the late 19th Century had been influenced mainly by economy, infrastructure and industry, whereas neighborhoods like Slotermeer and Bijlmermeer began in the mid century as experiment grounds for modernist aspiration for a better urban future, which later evolved beyond their original intentions. 

The body of work is not only an atlas of maps, plans, and images, but also a collection of events and decisions that promote, guide, or dictate urban transformations. The maps and plans both provide context and demonstrate results of these events and decisions. Working with open-source digital tools and aided by their capability of easy and accurate duplication, edit, and juxtaposition of archival materials, the comparison between changes over time becomes clearer and more interactive.
