This drawing depicts two interior renovations between the original floor plan and the current layout that have notably altered the spatial functions within a typical housing building on site. In Derde Helmersstraat 32, major renovations occurred when a previous homeowner of 32-1 purchased the ground floor unit 32-H to combine the two apartments. Here, the ground floor unit shifts from a commercial space to private residential. This combination allowed the homeowner to significantly maximize their living space by creating a split sublevel and adding an additional sleeping room. Another owner modified the unit by repainting the exterior, demolishing walls for an open living layout on the first floor, and giving the interior a high-quality renovation that preserves its historic character. Due to these attractive changes, the dwelling recently sold for â‚¬1.182.000, a record sale for the building.
