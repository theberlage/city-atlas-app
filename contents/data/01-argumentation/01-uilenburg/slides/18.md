The homes that existed on Uilenburg vary in size and spatial organization. The historical houses had a typical Dutch canal house layout, albeit much smaller in size and frequently a whole family would occupy only one room (1). In their place after the twentieth-century demolition following Woningwet 1901, new housing blocks were quickly built under the commission of social housing organizations that emerged by the end of the nineteenth century to improve the living environment for urban workers. The most prominent housing block on Uilenburg was designed by Johannes Hendrik Mulder in “Van der Tas type” with a four-room layout and a balcony (2), which could accommodate a family comfortably. By the end of the twentieth century, old warehouses on the island were renovated into apartments and houses. Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat 13-23 was converted into an apartment complex with a courtyard (3), which reveals the contemporary need for small, one- or two-room apartments with a shared outdoor space.
