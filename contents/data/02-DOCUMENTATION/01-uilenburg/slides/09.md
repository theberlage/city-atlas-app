# Planned Progress
Towards the end of WWII, Uilenburg arrived at its shape today. The clearance of small houses made room for the merge of Batavierstraat and Uilenburgerstraat to make an 18-meter-wide Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat, with nascent opportunities for planned greenery and public facilities for the neighborhood such as trash collection, streetlight, and parking plots. Besides the surviving buildings, new housing blocks were constructed along the new street. The obliteration of historical houses also caused the disappearance of Jewish small businesses that used to occupy the buildings’ ground floors, turning the area into almost a pure residential zone.
