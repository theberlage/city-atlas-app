# The expansion of Vijzelstraat
The urban planner Karel Petrus Cornelis De Bazel was commissioned as the supervisor of the Vizelstraat’s expansion project which was approved by the municipality in 1907.  The street was therefore widened from 10 meters to 22 in order to accommodate the new traffic network.
The demolition of the street started in 1917 and its reconstruction along with the new buildings was completed by 1928. It consisted of 103 buildings on the western side of the street which would be replaced by three large volumes: the Carlton hotel, the Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij’s headquarters and an residential building, also known as Amstelstein. These new massive buildings of 6 to 8 floors, would radically change the profile of the street which along with its widening had the ambition to transform it into a metropolitan boulevard.
