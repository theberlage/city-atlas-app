# Porosity & openness (before)
The original design by Nassuthâ€™s team included multiple cut-throughs (red) that aimed at connecting the vast ground to avoid long uninterrupted edges. Subsequently, the layout of the pathways was adjusted to such a permeable scheme, starting from and arriving at these nods.
The 1985 map shows that although this network had been built, the public function of the Maaiveld remained undefined. Moreover, since the access to the buildings was always through the garages, it was not necessary to cross through the green spaces for commuting. Hence, all the open volume was almost exclusively serving the sole function of recreation.
Ground floor plan of this Kleiburg block illustrates how most of the spaces were for storage and technical use, with the exception of the smaller part for commercial activities.
