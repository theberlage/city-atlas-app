The original seventeenth-century buildings (1) had shops on the ground floor (2) and housing on top, while the new apartment building was planned with the same functional qualities (3); the new, larger structure has an arcade with commercial spaces on the ground floor (4) and apartments on top (5). The 6.3-meter-height of the arcade provides ample space for the side walk beneath to become the extension for commercial activities. New stores benefited from the emergence of new materials, namely steel and glass that made large glass vitrines possible. These changes in the facade increased the interaction between goods and consumers and therefore the profit of the shop owners. In parallel, the existing buildings on the east side of the street underwent much more discreet transformations, preserving their scale and the original architecture.
